A gamemode I am making to practice coding in Garrys Mod. Its not very good.

Feel free to use this however you want. By default the round automatically starts when 2 players join the game. Default Vars are kept in shared.lua

Console commands are:

gg_round_start - Will start a round, by default requires 2 players
gg_round_end - Will end the round
gg_infinite_ammo (1 or 0) - Will enable infinite ammo for all players
gg_set_round_time (number in seconds) - Sets the time each round will take
gg_set_waiting_time (number in seconds) - Sets the time between rounds
gg_set_players (number of players) - Sets the number of players it takes for a round to start, by default its two
